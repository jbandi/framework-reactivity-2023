# Talk: Frontend Framework Reactivity

This repository contains the demos for my talk "From User Action to Framework Reaction: Reactivity in Angular, React, Vue and Svelte".

The talk mainly consists of live-coding demos.

The slides are here:

I held an initial version of this talk at "Bärner JS" in 2019.

I presented an extended version at "BaselOne 2022" (https://2022.baselone.ch/one).  
The final source code from the live-coding examples from the talk is here:
